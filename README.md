My solutions to 2024's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Notes
1. Day 1 has a good example of using `fold` to initialise a `HashMap`.
1. Day 2 part 2 is O(n^2) which is ok for the given input. I suspect O(n) could be achieved using two pointers but I'm going to move on.
1. Day 3 uses `regex`.
